# CGI-2048

CGI-2048 is an AI program for Game 2048. Developed CGI Lab(http://www.aigames.nctu.edu.tw/) Kun-Hao Yeh, Chao-Chin Liang, Chia-Chuan Chang in 2014~2015

Our algorithm is based on the following two papers:
[1] Szubert, M. amd Jaskowaski, W., “Temporal Difference Learning of N-tuple Networks for the Game 2048”, IEEE CIG 2014 conference, August 2014.

[2] I-Chen Wu, Kun-Hao Yeh, Chao-Chin Liang, Chia-Chuan Chang, and Han Chiang, "Multi-Stage Temporal Difference Learning for 2048", the 2014 Conference on Technologies and Applications of Artificial Intelligence (TAAI 2014), Taipei, Taiwan, Novemeber 2014.
