# CGI-2048

CGI-2048 is an AI program for Game 2048. Developed by CGI-Lab(http://www.aigames.nctu.edu.tw/) Kun-Hao Yeh, Chao-Chin Liang, Chia-Chuan Chang in 2014~2015

The performance of CGI-2048 is still improving. The table shows the performances of the early CGI-2048 (the one for the tournament), the latest improved CGI-2048, and Xificurk's program. To the best of our knowledge, Xificurk's outperformed all the known 2048 programs at the time before Octobor 2014. In November 2014, our latest CGI-2048 is able to perform better than Xificurk's. More importantly, ours runs about 300 times faster.
